# PHP.ActiveRecord ORM Bundle for Laravel

This bundle implements [PHP.ActiveRecord ORM](http://www.phpactiverecord.org/) based on [ActiveRecord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern) pattern.

Those who have used [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) will appreciate this ORM as it was inspired by RoR's ActiveRecord implementation.

# Installation

The installation is pretty straight-forward.

Using Laravel's artisan:

	php artisan bundle:install activerecord

Then in your `application/bundles.php`:

	return array('activerecord' => array('auto' => true));

Finally, set up your database connections in `application/database.php`.

# Configuration

In the configuration file (`(:bundle)/config/config.php`) you can set the path to the models directory:

	'models_dir'			=>	path('app').'models'

# Usage

A simple model example:

	<?php
	class User extends ActiveRecord\Model
	{

	}
